# Project_MailCheck
**Invi Mail** is a simple web-based email validation tool designed to check the authenticity of email addresses during user sign-up or registration. The tool evaluates the given email for validity using regex patterns and checks for temporary or disposable email domains. On form submission, it provides real-time feedback through a popup, along with an animated progress bar. This ensures that users input legitimate email addresses, preventing fake or temporary sign-ups. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a seamless and interactive user experience.
